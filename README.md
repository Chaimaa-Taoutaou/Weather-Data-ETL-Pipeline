# Weather-Data-ETL-Pipeline
This project is a data pipeline designed to collect, process, and store weather data for random cities around the world. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The pipeline performs data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) operations to ensure that the data is clean, formatted, and ready for analysis.
